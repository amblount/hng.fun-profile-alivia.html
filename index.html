              <p>Alivia is a Junior studying computer science at the University of California, Davis. Her journey into software stemmed from an understanding that the healthcare industry is trying to find technological solutions to its many problems, but has a long way to go. Alivia was a pre-medical student and after spending a summer doing biomedical research she understood that the work she was doing could, and probably should have been virtualized. Given Alivia spent so much time understanding the medical field, her path into computer science was non-traditional. Alivia took time away from school to complete two boot camps; Dev Bootcamp and General Assembly- on scholarship, to understand the fundamentals of web development. Alivia is also a current Code2040 summer fellow working as a data analytics intern at Intuit on the categorizations team. She is trying to understand what questions she should ask about the data to find ways to improve products being shipped to customers and make the current algorithms faster.</p>
